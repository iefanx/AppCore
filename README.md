**Key Features:**

* **Native App Launcher:** Organize and seamlessly launch or multitask between native apps and websites.
* **URL & Text Store:** Quickly access frequently used websites and securely store important text with advanced local encryption.
* **Built-in Browser:** Enjoy native custom tabs, lightning-fast performance, multitasking with floating windows, and trustless extension/account sync with your default browser.
* **Other features:** Lightning-fast, private, and offline-first, with no gatekeeping, no trackers, and Nostr integration (in progress). Expect rapid upgrades, too.

**For Early Testers:** Thank you for your ongoing feedback and suggestions. I firmly believe in user-driven development. Please don't hesitate to propose features that would enhance AppCore's usefulness for you.

**Last but not least:** I highly recommend keeping AppCore in Obtainium, as it will continue to improve. Within the next 20 days, I aim to make it one of the best in its category before uploading it to the Play Store.
